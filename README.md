# PMAviationPresets

In my usual daytime hobby of taking airplane pictures, I use Photo Mechanic Plus to tag images as I import them to storage. These are presets I use to tag the images of airports, airlines, and aircraft types.

They're probably not of much use to anyone else but feel free to poke around.
